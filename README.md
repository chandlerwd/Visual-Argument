This GitHub Repo is for Composing Digital Media fall semester of 2021. Included in this repository are screenshots of the images used within my project and my final-for-now project on Gimp as well as a source list. My visual argument depicts the 4 different types of bullying and aims to inform the viewer of them as well as serve as an anti-bullying visual aid. I wanted to use a group of photos from the same series in order to make the project as cohesive as possible. I would argue that the main principles present in my piece are visual rhythm and visual dominance. In terms of visual rhythm, my use of images from one particular photo shoot involving the same actors how to tell my story of what bullying may look like and contribute to the general cohesiveness of the project. For visual dominance, the focal point of my project lies in the "stop bullying" and no symbol in the center. I purposely made the types of bullying in a smaller, more subtle font to bring attention to the elements in the center of my project.
